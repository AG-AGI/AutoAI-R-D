## Differentiable Search Space Pruning for Efficient Neural Architecture Search

**Abstract:** Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown remarkable success in automating the design of neural networks. However, the computational cost associated with exploring large search spaces remains a significant bottleneck. This paper introduces Differentiable Search Space Pruning (DSSP), a novel approach that integrates differentiable pruning techniques within the NAS process to dynamically reduce the search space during training. DSSP learns to identify and eliminate unpromising architectural components, leading to faster convergence and improved performance.

**1. Introduction**

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the process of designing neural network architectures, freeing human experts from laborious manual design. Current NAS methods, however, suffer from high computational costs, particularly when exploring extensive architectural search spaces. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods, such as DARTS [1], have improved efficiency by relaxing the search space to be continuous and differentiable, allowing for gradient-based optimization of architectural parameters. However, even DNAS methods can become computationally expensive when dealing with complex or excessively large search spaces. This paper introduces Differentiable Search Space Pruning (DSSP) to address this limitation. DSSP combines differentiable architecture search with structured pruning techniques to dynamically reduce the search space during training, leading to faster convergence and better performance.

**2. Related Work**

Differentiable NAS methods, such as DARTS [1] and SNAS [2], represent a significant advancement in NAS by enabling gradient-based optimization of network architectures. These methods often involve relaxing the discrete architectural choices into continuous parameters, which can then be optimized using gradient descent. However, the computational cost remains a challenge, especially for large search spaces. Pruning techniques have been successfully applied to reduce the size and complexity of trained neural networks [3]. Structured pruning, in particular, focuses on removing entire filters, channels, or even layers, leading to more efficient architectures. Our approach combines differentiable NAS with structured pruning to dynamically reduce the search space during the search process.

**3. Differentiable Search Space Pruning (DSSP)**

DSSP operates within a DNAS framework, augmenting the architectural parameters with learnable pruning masks. These masks determine which architectural components are retained or pruned during training.

**3.1. Architecture Encoding**

We adopt a cell-based search space, where the network is composed of a sequence of repeated cells. Each cell consists of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with *N* nodes, each representing a latent feature map. The edges connecting the nodes represent candidate operations chosen from a predefined set, such as convolutions, pooling, and identity mappings. Each edge (i, j) is associated with a mixture weight, *α<sub>ij</sub>*, that determines the contribution of each operation.

**3.2. Pruning Masking**

We introduce a pruning mask, *m<sub>ij</sub>*, for each edge (i, j) in the cell. The mask *m<sub>ij</sub>* is a learnable parameter, initialized to 1, and constrained between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PruningMask(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.mask = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))  # Initialize mask to 1

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.mask) * x # Applies the mask to the input

# Example Usage
pruning_mask = PruningMask()
input_tensor = torch.randn(10)
output_tensor = pruning_mask(input_tensor)

print(output_tensor)
```

The output of each operation *o<sub>ij</sub>* is then weighted by *α<sub>ij</sub>* *m<sub>ij</sub>*. As *m<sub>ij</sub>* approaches 0, the corresponding operation is effectively pruned from the search space.

**3.3. Optimization**

The objective function is a combination of a performance loss, *L<sub>perf</sub>*, and a pruning regularization term, *L<sub>prune</sub>*:

*L* = *L<sub>perf</sub>* + *λ* *L<sub>prune</sub>*

where *λ* is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the pruning regularization. The performance loss *L<sub>perf</sub>* is typically the cross-entropy loss for classification tasks. The pruning regularization term encourages the pruning masks to approach 0, promoting sparsity in the search space. We define *L<sub>prune</sub>* as:

*L<sub>prune</sub>* =  Σ<sub>i,j</sub> |*m<sub>ij</sub>*|

**3.4 Code Example**

Here is a code example for pruning in C++ using Eigen library

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>

using namespace Eigen;

// Function to prune a matrix based on a mask
MatrixXd pruneMatrix(const MatrixXd& matrix, const MatrixXd& mask) {
    if (matrix.rows() != mask.rows() || matrix.cols() != mask.cols()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Matrix and mask dimensions must match." << std::endl;
        return matrix; // Or throw an exception
    }

    MatrixXd prunedMatrix = matrix.array() * mask.array(); // Element-wise multiplication

    return prunedMatrix;
}

int main() {
    // Example Matrix
    MatrixXd matrix(3, 3);
    matrix << 1, 2, 3,
              4, 5, 6,
              7, 8, 9;

    // Example Mask (0 for pruning, 1 for keeping)
    MatrixXd mask(3, 3);
    mask << 1, 0, 1,
            0, 1, 0,
            1, 0, 1;

    // Prune the matrix
    MatrixXd prunedMatrix = pruneMatrix(matrix, mask);

    // Print the original and pruned matrices
    std::cout << "Original Matrix:\n" << matrix << std::endl;
    std::cout << "\nMask:\n" << mask << std::endl;
    std::cout << "\nPruned Matrix:\n" << prunedMatrix << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**4. Experimental Results**

We evaluated DSSP on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using a cell-based search space. Our results demonstrate that DSSP significantly reduces the computational cost of NAS while achieving comparable or better performance than standard DNAS methods. Specifically, DSSP converges faster and identifies more efficient architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

**5. Conclusion**

Differentiable Search Space Pruning (DSSP) offers a promising approach for improving the efficiency of Neural Architecture Search. By integrating differentiable pruning techniques into the search process, DSSP dynamically reduces the search space, leading to faster convergence and improved performance. Future work will explore the application of DSSP to more complex search spaces and tasks.
