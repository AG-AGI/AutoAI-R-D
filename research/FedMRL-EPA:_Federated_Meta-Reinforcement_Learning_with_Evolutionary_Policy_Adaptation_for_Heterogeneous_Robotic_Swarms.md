## Federated Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Evolutionary Policy Adaptation for Heterogeneous Robotic Swarms

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training decentralized machine learning models without directly sharing private data. However, applying FL to Reinforcement Learning (RL) in robotic swarms presents significant challenges, particularly concerning heterogeneity in robot capabilities, environmental conditions, and task objectives. This paper introduces FedMRL-EPA, a novel Federated Meta-Reinforcement Learning framework augmented with Evolutionary Policy Adaptation for effectively training robust and personalized control policies for heterogeneous robotic swarms. FedMRL-EPA leverages meta-learning to establish a shared policy prior across the swarm, facilitating rapid adaptation to individual robot characteristics. To address heterogeneity, we integrate an evolutionary algorithm that allows each robot to fine-tune its policy based on its local experience and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMRL-EPA in simulated robotic swarm navigation and object manipulation tasks, showcasing improved convergence speed, personalized performance, and robustness against noisy and incomplete data compared to traditional FL and RL methods.

**1. Introduction**

Robotic swarms hold immense potential for tackling complex tasks in diverse environments, including search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and collaborative construction [1]. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for training robots to autonomously learn optimal control policies through trial and error. However, training RL policies for large-scale heterogeneous robotic swarms using traditional centralized approaches is often impractical due to communication bottlenecks, data privacy concerns, and the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of decentralized data.

Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a viable alternative, allowing robots to train models locally using their private data and then collaboratively aggregate these models to create a global, shared policy [2]. Despite its promise, applying FL to RL in robotic swarms faces significant challenges:

*   **Heterogeneity:** Robotic swarms often consist of robots with varying capabilities (e.g., sensor types, actuator strengths), operating in different environments, and pursuing distinct, yet related, task objectives. Standard FL algorithms, designed for i.i.d. data, struggle to effectively handle such heterogeneity.
*   **Convergence:** The decentralized nature of FL can lead to slow convergence rates, especially when dealing with sparse reward signals and complex state spaces characteristic of RL tasks.
*   **Personalization:** A single global policy may not be optimal for all robots in the swarm. Individual robots may require specialized policies tailored to their specific characteristics and local environments.

This paper proposes FedMRL-EPA, a novel Federated Meta-Reinforcement Learning framework augmented with Evolutionary Policy Adaptation, to address these challenges. Our approach combines the benefits of meta-learning, FL, and evolutionary algorithms to achieve robust and personalized policy learning in heterogeneous robotic swarms. Meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks and environments by learning a shared policy prior. FL facilitates decentralized training while preserving data privacy. Finally, evolutionary policy adaptation allows each robot to fine-tune its policy based on its local experience, addressing heterogeneity and promoting personalization.

**2. Related Work**

Our work builds upon existing research in Federated Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Meta-Learning.

*   **Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL):**  Previous works have explored FRL for robotics, focusing on improving convergence and personalization in homogeneous settings [3]. However, these methods often struggle with significant heterogeneity in robot capabilities and task objectives.
*   **Meta-Reinforcement Learning (MRL):** MRL has been used to learn policies that can quickly adapt to new environments. However, MRL often requires centralized training, which is not suitable for robotic swarms with data privacy concerns.
*   **Evolutionary Algorithms in RL:** Evolutionary algorithms have been used to optimize RL policies directly, but they can be computationally expensive, especially for complex tasks.

FedMRL-EPA combines these approaches to achieve robust and personalized policy learning in heterogeneous robotic swarms, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

**3. FedMRL-EPA Framework**

FedMRL-EPA consists of three main components:

*   **Meta-Learner:** A meta-learner, implemented using a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach, learns a shared policy prior across all robots. This prior captures general knowledge about the task domain and facilitates rapid adaptation to individual robot characteristics. The meta-learner is trained centrally on a small subset of simulated data, representing a range of possible robot configurations and environmental conditions.
*   **Federated Aggregation:** The meta-learned policy prior is then distributed to each robot in the swarm. Each robot fine-tunes the policy locally using its own experiences, generating local policy updates. These updates are aggregated using a Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to create a global, shared policy, which is then redistributed to all robots.
*   **Evolutionary Policy Adaptation (EPA):** To address heterogeneity, each robot employs an evolutionary algorithm to further refine its policy based on its local experience and environmental constraints. The evolutionary algorithm searches for optimal policy parameters that maximize a robot's individual performance, subject to constraints such as energy consumption and collision avoidance.

**4. Experimental Results**

We evaluated FedMRL-EPA in simulated robotic swarm navigation and object manipulation tasks. The robotic swarm consisted of heterogeneous robots with varying sensor ranges, motor strengths, and initial positions. The task objectives varied across robots, requiring them to navigate to different target locations or manipulate objects of different sizes and weights.

The results showed that FedMRL-EPA significantly outperformed traditional FL and RL methods in terms of convergence speed, personalized performance, and robustness against noisy and incomplete data. Specifically:

*   **Convergence Speed:** FedMRL-EPA converged significantly faster than traditional FL methods, as the meta-learned policy prior provided a strong initialization for the local policy learning process.
*   **Personalized Performance:** The evolutionary policy adaptation component enabled each robot to fine-tune its policy to its specific characteristics and local environment, resulting in significantly improved individual performance compared to using a single global policy.
*   **Robustness:** FedMRL-EPA demonstrated greater robustness against noisy and incomplete data, as the meta-learned policy prior provided a regularization effect that prevented overfitting to local noise.

**5. Conclusion**

This paper introduced FedMRL-EPA, a novel Federated Meta-Reinforcement Learning framework augmented with Evolutionary Policy Adaptation for effectively training robust and personalized control policies for heterogeneous robotic swarms. The framework leverages meta-learning to establish a shared policy prior, FL to facilitate decentralized training, and evolutionary policy adaptation to address heterogeneity and promote personalization. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of FedMRL-EPA in simulated robotic swarm navigation and object manipulation tasks. Future research will focus on extending FedMRL-EPA to more complex and realistic robotic swarm scenarios, including deployment on real-world robots.
