## Federated Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum-Based Training for Autonomous Driving

**Abstract**

Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) holds immense potential for training autonomous driving agents across diverse and decentralized datasets. However, non-i.i.d. data distributions and varying environmental complexities across clients pose significant challenges to effective learning. This paper proposes a novel curriculum-based federated reinforcement learning (CB-FRL) framework. The core idea is to leverage a curriculum that gradually increases the difficulty of the driving scenarios, enabling clients to learn more effectively from their local data while promoting knowledge transfer across the federated network. We introduce a dynamic curriculum adaptation strategy that adjusts the curriculum based on client performance and environmental characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that CB-FRL significantly outperforms traditional FRL methods in terms of convergence speed, driving safety, and generalization ability in complex and heterogeneous driving environments.

**1. Introduction**

Autonomous driving relies heavily on reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents that can navigate complex and dynamic environments. Traditional RL approaches often require massive amounts of centralized data, which may be unavailable or impractical due to privacy concerns, data heterogeneity, and storage limitations. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, directly applying standard FL algorithms to RL for autonomous driving faces several challenges. First, the data distributions across different clients (e.g., vehicles operating in different cities) are inherently non-i.i.d. Second, the complexity of driving environments can vary significantly, leading to imbalanced learning progress across clients. Simply averaging local models trained on diverse data and environments may result in a sub-optimal global policy.

To address these challenges, we propose a curriculum-based federated reinforcement learning (CB-FRL) framework. Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that gradually increases the difficulty of the learning task, starting with simple examples and progressing to more complex ones [1]. By incorporating CL into FRL, we enable clients to learn from progressively more challenging driving scenarios, fostering a more robust and generalizable policy.

**2. Related Work**

Our work builds upon the foundations of federated learning, reinforcement learning, and curriculum learning. Previous research on FRL has focused on addressing data heterogeneity through techniques such as knowledge distillation [2] and personalized federated learning. However, these methods often neglect the varying environmental complexities across clients.

Curriculum learning has been successfully applied in various RL domains, including robotics and game playing. However, existing CL methods are typically designed for centralized training settings and do not account for the decentralized nature of federated learning.  Our work bridges this gap by developing a curriculum adaptation strategy tailored to the federated learning setting.

**3. Proposed Approach: CB-FRL**

The CB-FRL framework consists of the following key components:

*   **Local Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Each client trains a local RL agent using a specific driving simulator. The agent learns a policy that maps the current state of the environment to an action.
*   **Curriculum Design:** We define a curriculum consisting of a sequence of driving scenarios with increasing complexity. The complexity can be measured by factors such as traffic density, road curvature, and weather conditions.
*   **Dynamic Curriculum Adaptation:** The server maintains a global curriculum and monitors the performance of each client. Based on client performance (e.g., success rate, collision rate) and environmental characteristics, the server dynamically adjusts the curriculum for each client. For example, if a client is struggling with a particular scenario, the server may temporarily assign it a simpler scenario. Conversely, if a client is performing well, the server may advance it to a more challenging scenario.
*   **Federated Aggregation:** After each training round, the server aggregates the local models from the clients using a federated averaging algorithm. The aggregated model is then distributed back to the clients for the next training round.

**4. Experiments and Results**

We evaluated CB-FRL on a simulated autonomous driving environment using the CARLA simulator. The simulation includes diverse driving scenarios with varying traffic density, weather conditions, and road layouts. We compared CB-FRL with the following baseline methods:

*   **FedAvg:** Standard federated averaging applied to RL.
*   **FedProx:** Federated averaging with proximal regularization to mitigate data heterogeneity.

The results demonstrate that CB-FRL significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, driving safety, and generalization ability. CB-FRL achieves a higher success rate and lower collision rate in complex driving scenarios compared to FedAvg and FedProx. This indicates that the curriculum-based training strategy effectively improves the robustness and generalization ability of the learned policy.

**5. Conclusion**

We presented CB-FRL, a novel curriculum-based federated reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving. CB-FRL addresses the challenges of non-i.i.d. data and varying environmental complexities by leveraging a dynamic curriculum adaptation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CB-FRL significantly outperforms traditional FRL methods in terms of convergence speed, driving safety, and generalization ability. Future work will focus on exploring more sophisticated curriculum design strategies and incorporating privacy-preserving techniques into the CB-FRL framework.
