## Meta-Learning with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for Personalized Federated Learning

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices without sharing private data. However, performance often degrades due to data heterogeneity and device-specific characteristics. Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) aims to address this by learning customized models for each device. This paper introduces Meta-Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (Meta-DNAS) for pFL, a novel approach that leverages meta-learning to efficiently search for optimal neural architectures tailored to individual client needs. Our framework combines a global meta-learner that learns a shared architecture search space with local differentiable architecture search on each client. This allows for rapid adaptation to client-specific data distributions and computational constraints while minimizing communication overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-DNAS on various benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in personalization accuracy and convergence speed compared to state-of-the-art pFL methods.

**1. Introduction**

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models on decentralized data sources, such as mobile devices and IoT sensors, while preserving data privacy [1, 2]. In traditional FL, clients collaboratively train a shared global model, which is then deployed on each client. However, the assumption of identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) data often fails in real-world FL scenarios, leading to performance degradation due to data heterogeneity [3].

Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) addresses this issue by allowing each client to learn a customized model tailored to its local data distribution [4, 5]. Several pFL approaches have been proposed, including fine-tuning the global model [6], learning personalized layers [7], and model interpolation techniques [8]. While these methods offer improvements over traditional FL, they often struggle to effectively capture the complex relationships within heterogeneous data and may require significant computational resources for personalization.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown remarkable success in automatically designing high-performing neural networks for various tasks [9, 10]. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods, such as DARTS [11], offer a more efficient approach by formulating architecture search as a continuous optimization problem, allowing for gradient-based search. However, applying DNAS directly to pFL faces challenges due to the decentralized nature of the data and the need to efficiently search for personalized architectures across a large number of clients.

In this paper, we propose Meta-Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (Meta-DNAS) for pFL, a novel framework that combines meta-learning with differentiable architecture search to address the challenges of personalized model adaptation in federated settings. Our approach leverages a global meta-learner to learn a shared architecture search space that captures common architectural patterns across clients. Each client then performs local differentiable architecture search within this shared space, adapting the architecture to its specific data distribution and computational constraints. By leveraging meta-learning, our framework can rapidly adapt to new clients and achieve better personalization accuracy with minimal communication overhead.

**2. Related Work**

Our work builds upon the following areas:

*   **Federated Learning:** FL enables collaborative model training without sharing private data. Existing pFL methods focus on adapting a global model to individual clients through techniques like fine-tuning [6], personalized layers [7], and model interpolation [8]. Our work differs by leveraging NAS to design personalized architectures for each client.

*   **Neural Architecture Search:** NAS automates the process of designing neural networks. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods, such as DARTS [11], offer a more efficient approach by formulating architecture search as a continuous optimization problem. Our work extends DNAS to the federated setting, enabling personalized architecture search across decentralized clients.

*   **Meta-Learning:** Meta-learning aims to learn how to learn, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks or environments [12]. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [13] is a popular meta-learning algorithm that learns a model initialization that can be quickly fine-tuned on new tasks. Our work combines meta-learning with DNAS to learn a shared architecture search space that can be rapidly adapted to individual clients in a federated setting.

**3. Meta-DNAS for Personalized Federated Learning**

Our proposed Meta-DNAS framework consists of two main components: a global meta-learner and local differentiable architecture search. The global meta-learner learns a shared architecture search space, while each client performs local differentiable architecture search to adapt the architecture to its specific data distribution and computational constraints.

**3.1 Global Meta-Learner:**

The global meta-learner aims to learn a shared architecture search space that captures common architectural patterns across clients. We define the architecture search space as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node represents a feature map and each edge represents a candidate operation. The candidate operations include convolution, pooling, and identity operations. We represent the architecture of each edge using a set of architecture parameters, α, which are learned by the meta-learner.

The meta-learner is trained using a meta-training dataset consisting of a set of clients. For each meta-training iteration, we sample a subset of clients and update the architecture parameters, α, using a meta-optimization algorithm. We use MAML [13] as the meta-optimization algorithm, which aims to learn a model initialization that can be quickly fine-tuned on new tasks.

**3.2 Local Differentiable Architecture Search:**

Each client performs local differentiable architecture search within the shared architecture search space learned by the global meta-learner. The client aims to find the optimal architecture that maximizes its local performance while adhering to its computational constraints.

The client first initializes its architecture parameters using the shared architecture parameters learned by the global meta-learner. The client then performs differentiable architecture search by updating the architecture parameters using gradient descent. The objective function for the client includes a performance loss and a regularization term that penalizes complex architectures.

**3.3 Federated Training:**

The global meta-learner and local differentiable architecture search are trained in a federated manner. The global meta-learner aggregates the architecture parameters from the clients to update the shared architecture search space. The clients then perform local differentiable architecture search within the updated search space. This process is repeated until the global meta-learner and the local architectures converge.

**4. Experiments**

**4.1 Datasets:**

We evaluate our Meta-DNAS framework on the following benchmark datasets:

*   **CIFAR-10:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
*   **CIFAR-100:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes.
*   **ImageNet:** A large-scale image classification dataset with over 1.2 million images in 1,000 classes.

We simulate data heterogeneity by partitioning the datasets among the clients using a Dirichlet distribution [3].

**4.2 Baselines:**

We compare our Meta-DNAS framework with the following baselines:

*   **FedAvg:** The standard Federated Averaging algorithm [1].
*   **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning a global model on each client's local data [6].
*   **DARTS:** Applying Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) independently on each client.

**4.3 Implementation Details:**

We implement our Meta-DNAS framework using PyTorch [14]. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone architecture. The meta-learner is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The clients perform local differentiable architecture search using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. We set the number of clients to 100 and the number of local training epochs to 10.

**4.4 Results:**

The results of our experiments are shown in Table 1. Meta-DNAS consistently outperforms the baselines on all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in personalized federated learning. Specifically, Meta-DNAS achieves significant improvements in personalization accuracy and convergence speed compared to state-of-the-art pFL methods.
