## Cross-Modal Attention Fusion with Differentiable Knowledge Distillation for Enhanced Low-Resource Machine Translation

**Abstract:** Machine translation (MT) relies heavily on large parallel corpora. However, many language pairs lack sufficient data for training robust models, leading to performance degradation. This paper introduces a novel Cross-Modal Attention Fusion with Differentiable Knowledge Distillation (CAF-DKD) framework to address this challenge. Our approach leverages readily available visual data (images) as auxiliary information to enhance MT performance in low-resource scenarios. CAF-DKD employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to fuse visual and textual representations within the encoder. Furthermore, we utilize differentiable knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a high-resource teacher model, pre-trained on a related language pair, to a low-resource student model. The effectiveness of CAF-DKD is demonstrated on benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline models in terms of BLEU score, especially when training data is scarce.

**1. Introduction**

Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, largely driven by the availability of large parallel corpora [1]. However, the performance of NMT models deteriorates significantly when training data is limited, as is the case for many language pairs. Low-resource machine translation (LRMT) has therefore become an important research area.

Various techniques have been explored to tackle LRMT, including back-translation, transfer learning, and multilingual training. Another promising avenue is to leverage auxiliary information from other modalities, such as images. Images can provide contextual information that complements the text, particularly for ambiguous or low-frequency words.

This paper proposes a Cross-Modal Attention Fusion with Differentiable Knowledge Distillation (CAF-DKD) framework for LRMT. Our approach fuses visual and textual representations using a cross-modal attention mechanism within the encoder. The encoder learns to attend to relevant parts of the image based on the textual input, and vice versa. In addition, we incorporate differentiable knowledge distillation [2] to transfer knowledge from a high-resource teacher model to a low-resource student model. This helps the student model learn more effectively from the limited data.

**2. Related Work**

Several studies have explored the use of multimodal information for machine translation.  [3] uses image captions. Our work differs in that we use a cross-modal attention mechanism to fuse visual and textual representations and incorporate differentiable knowledge distillation to further improve performance.

**3. Methodology**

The CAF-DKD framework consists of three main components: (1) a cross-modal encoder, (2) a standard decoder, and (3) a knowledge distillation module.

**3.1. Cross-Modal Encoder**

The cross-modal encoder takes both textual and visual inputs. The textual input is first embedded using a standard word embedding layer. The visual input is represented by features extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet.

A key component of the cross-modal encoder is the attention mechanism that fuses the textual and visual representations. We use a multi-head attention mechanism. Let $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ be the textual embeddings and $V = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_m]$ be the visual features. The attention weights are computed as:

$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$

where $Q$ is the query (derived from the textual embeddings), $K$ and $V$ are the key and value (derived from the visual features). This allows the encoder to attend to relevant parts of the image based on the textual input. The output of the attention mechanism is then concatenated with the original textual embeddings and passed through a feed-forward network.

**3.2. Decoder**

The decoder is a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism, such as GRU or LSTM. It takes the output of the cross-modal encoder as input and generates the target sequence.

**3.3. Knowledge Distillation**

Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller "student" model to mimic the behavior of a larger "teacher" model. In our case, the teacher model is pre-trained on a high-resource language pair, and the student model is trained on the low-resource language pair.

We use differentiable knowledge distillation, which allows us to directly transfer the knowledge from the teacher model to the student model by minimizing the KL divergence between the softmax outputs of the two models:

$L_{KD} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} KL(p_T(y_i|x_i) || p_S(y_i|x_i))$

where $p_T$ and $p_S$ are the softmax probabilities of the teacher and student models, respectively, and $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the input and output sequences.

The overall loss function is a weighted sum of the cross-entropy loss and the knowledge distillation loss:

$L = \lambda L_{CE} + (1 - \lambda) L_{KD}$

where $L_{CE}$ is the cross-entropy loss and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the relative importance of the two losses.

**4. Experiments**

**4.1. Datasets**

We evaluated the CAF-DKD framework on the Multi30k dataset. We use the English-German (En-De) language pair for low-resource experiments. The image data from Multi30k are utilized as visual inputs.

**4.2. Implementation Details**

We implemented the CAF-DKD framework using PyTorch. We used a ResNet-18 model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract visual features. The teacher model was trained on the full Multi30k En-De dataset, while the student model was trained on a small subset of the data (e.g., 1k, 5k, or 10k sentence pairs).

**4.3. Results**

Our experiments showed that the CAF-DKD framework significantly outperformed the baseline models in terms of BLEU score. In particular, the improvements were most pronounced when the amount of training data was very limited (e.g., 1k sentence pairs). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging visual information and knowledge distillation to enhance MT performance in low-resource scenarios.
