## Federated Learning with Hierarchical Clustering for Personalized Model Aggregation

**Abstract**

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, data heterogeneity across clients remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes FedHC, a novel federated learning framework incorporating hierarchical clustering for personalized model aggregation. FedHC dynamically groups clients based on model similarity, forming a hierarchy that reflects the underlying data structure. Aggregation is then performed within each cluster, allowing for more specialized and personalized models. We demonstrate that FedHC outperforms traditional FL aggregation methods in terms of accuracy and personalization, particularly in highly heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, FedHC enhances robustness against malicious clients by isolating them within smaller clusters, limiting their influence on the global model.

**1. Introduction**

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training without requiring clients to share their raw data [1]. However, real-world FL deployments often encounter significant challenges due to data heterogeneity across clients, resulting in suboptimal model performance and hindering personalization. Traditional FL approaches, such as FedAvg, typically aggregate model updates by averaging them across all clients, assuming that all data is identically distributed. This assumption is frequently violated in practice, leading to a phenomenon known as "model averaging staleness" where the global model is not well-suited for any particular client.

To address the data heterogeneity problem, various personalized FL methods have been proposed. These methods aim to tailor the global model to each client's local data distribution. One common approach involves fine-tuning the global model on local data after each round of federated training. While effective, fine-tuning can be computationally expensive and may require clients to store the global model, which could be a privacy concern. Another approach is to learn client-specific adaptation layers on top of a shared global model. This approach reduces the computational burden but may not fully capture the underlying data structure.

In this paper, we propose FedHC, a novel personalized FL framework that utilizes hierarchical clustering to address data heterogeneity and enhance model personalization. FedHC dynamically groups clients based on the similarity of their local models, forming a hierarchy that reflects the underlying data structure. This hierarchy is constructed using a pairwise distance metric computed between the gradients of local models. Model aggregation is then performed within each cluster, allowing for more specialized and personalized models.  By grouping clients with similar data distributions, FedHC reduces the impact of data heterogeneity and improves model personalization. Furthermore, FedHC enhances robustness against malicious clients by isolating them within smaller clusters, limiting their influence on the global model.

**2. Related Work**

Several approaches have been proposed to address the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning.  *Meta-Learning with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for Personalized Federated Learning* aims to find architecture better for each user. [3] Another approach is to use data augmentation techniques to address this [5]. Other approaches such as *Federated Learning with Graph Neural Network Guided Architecture Adaptation for Communication-Constrained Edge Devices* use GNNs to improve performance [2]. These methods often focus on local adaptation or knowledge transfer to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. Our work complements these approaches by providing a dynamic clustering framework that can be combined with other personalization techniques.

**3. Proposed Method: FedHC**

The FedHC framework consists of the following steps:

1.  **Local Model Training:** Each client trains a local model on its own dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or a variant thereof.
2.  **Gradient Upload:** Each client uploads the gradient of its local model to the server.
3.  **Hierarchical Clustering:** The server computes a pairwise distance matrix between the gradients of all clients. Hierarchical clustering is then applied to this distance matrix to group clients into clusters. The distance metric is chosen to reflect the similarity between the model updates. Cosine similarity between the gradient vectors is used in our case:
    `distance(i, j) = 1 - cosine_similarity(gradient_i, gradient_j)`
4.  **Model Aggregation:** The server aggregates the model updates within each cluster separately. This allows for more specialized and personalized models. The aggregation is performed using a weighted average of the model updates, where the weights are proportional to the number of data points in each client's local dataset. The aggregated model for each cluster is then sent back to the clients within that cluster.
5.  **Model Update:** Each client updates its local model with the aggregated model received from the server.
6.  **Iteration:** Steps 1-5 are repeated for a fixed number of rounds.

The hierarchical clustering step is performed using Ward's linkage, which minimizes the variance within each cluster. The number of clusters can be determined using various criteria, such as the silhouette score or the elbow method.

**4. Experiments**

We evaluate FedHC on a variety of datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a synthetic dataset with varying degrees of data heterogeneity. We compare FedHC to traditional FedAvg and other personalized FL methods. The results show that FedHC consistently outperforms FedAvg in terms of accuracy and personalization, particularly in highly heterogeneous environments.

**5. Conclusion**

This paper introduces FedHC, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates hierarchical clustering for personalized model aggregation. FedHC dynamically groups clients based on model similarity, forming a hierarchy that reflects the underlying data structure. Aggregation is then performed within each cluster, allowing for more specialized and personalized models. Experiments demonstrate that FedHC outperforms traditional FL aggregation methods in terms of accuracy and personalization, particularly in highly heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, FedHC enhances robustness against malicious clients by isolating them within smaller clusters, limiting their influence on the global model. Future work will focus on exploring more sophisticated clustering algorithms and incorporating privacy-preserving techniques.
