## Federated Learning with Attention-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Imbalanced Data

**Abstract**

Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges when dealing with imbalanced data distributions across participating clients. Clients with fewer samples in certain classes can disproportionately affect the global model, leading to biased performance and reduced generalization, particularly for minority classes. This paper introduces FedAKD, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates attention-guided knowledge distillation to mitigate the impact of imbalanced data. FedAKD leverages local attention mechanisms to identify salient features in client data, allowing the global model to learn a more robust and balanced representation. Furthermore, knowledge distillation transfers rich information from the local models to the global model, compensating for data scarcity in minority classes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves the performance of FL models on imbalanced data, particularly for minority classes, while maintaining privacy and communication efficiency.

**1. Introduction**

Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models on decentralized data, enabling collaborative learning without compromising data privacy [1]. However, FL faces several challenges in real-world scenarios, including data heterogeneity, communication constraints, and imbalanced data distributions. Data imbalance, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others, poses a significant challenge, particularly in applications such as medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and rare event prediction. In federated settings, data imbalance is often exacerbated by the diverse data distributions across participating clients. Clients with fewer samples in certain classes can disproportionately influence the global model, resulting in biased predictions and reduced generalization performance for minority classes.

Existing approaches to address data imbalance in FL often rely on techniques such as data augmentation, re-sampling, or cost-sensitive learning. However, these methods can be ineffective in federated settings due to privacy concerns and communication limitations. Data augmentation may require sharing raw data, violating privacy constraints. Re-sampling and cost-sensitive learning can lead to biased gradients and instability during federated training. Therefore, a novel approach is needed to address data imbalance in FL while preserving privacy and communication efficiency.

This paper introduces FedAKD, a federated learning framework that incorporates attention-guided knowledge distillation to mitigate the impact of imbalanced data. FedAKD leverages local attention mechanisms to identify salient features in client data, allowing the global model to learn a more robust and balanced representation. Furthermore, knowledge distillation transfers rich information from the local models to the global model, compensating for data scarcity in minority classes. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

*   We propose FedAKD, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates attention-guided knowledge distillation to address data imbalance.
*   We introduce local attention mechanisms to identify salient features in client data, enabling the global model to learn a more robust representation.
*   We leverage knowledge distillation to transfer rich information from local models to the global model, compensating for data scarcity in minority classes.
*   We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of FedAKD in improving the performance of FL models on imbalanced data.

**2. Related Work**

Several approaches have been proposed to address data imbalance in machine learning. Data augmentation techniques, such as SMOTE [2] and Random Oversampling, generate synthetic samples for minority classes. However, these methods may introduce noise and distort the data distribution. Re-sampling techniques, such as undersampling the majority class, can lead to information loss and biased models. Cost-sensitive learning assigns higher weights to minority classes to penalize misclassification errors. However, these methods can be sensitive to the choice of weights.

In federated learning, data imbalance is a more challenging problem due to the decentralized nature of the data and the privacy constraints. Existing approaches to address data imbalance in FL often rely on modifications to the aggregation process, such as weighted averaging of model updates. However, these methods may not be effective when the data imbalance is severe. Knowledge distillation has been used in FL to transfer knowledge from local models to the global model, improving generalization performance [3]. However, existing approaches to knowledge distillation in FL do not explicitly address data imbalance.

**3. FedAKD: Attention-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Federated Learning**

The architecture of FedAKD consists of three main components: local attention mechanism, federated learning aggregation, and knowledge distillation.

**3.1 Local Attention Mechanism**

Each client trains a local model with an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism identifies salient features in the client's data that are most relevant for classification. Let *x* be the input data, and *f(x)* be the output of the local model before the classification layer. The attention mechanism computes an attention weight *a* for each feature in *f(x)*:

*a = softmax(W*f(x))*),

where *W* is a learnable weight matrix. The attention-weighted features are then used to make predictions.

**3.2 Federated Learning Aggregation**

The local models are aggregated using a federated learning algorithm, such as FedAvg. The server collects the model updates from each client and computes a weighted average of the updates. The aggregated model is then sent back to the clients for the next round of training.

**3.3 Knowledge Distillation**

Knowledge distillation is used to transfer knowledge from the local models to the global model. The global model is trained to mimic the predictions of the local models. Let *p_i* be the predicted probabilities of the local model *i*, and *q* be the predicted probabilities of the global model. The knowledge distillation loss is defined as:

*L_KD = KL(p_i, q)*,

where *KL* is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The total loss for the global model is a weighted sum of the cross-entropy loss and the knowledge distillation loss:

*L = L_CE + λL_KD*,

where *L_CE* is the cross-entropy loss, and λ is a hyperparameter that controls the importance of knowledge distillation.

**4. Experiments**

We evaluate the performance of FedAKD on benchmark datasets. The datasets are artificially imbalanced to simulate realistic scenarios. We compare FedAKD to baseline methods, including FedAvg and FedAvg with data augmentation. The results show that FedAKD significantly improves the performance of FL models on imbalanced data, particularly for minority classes.

**5. Conclusion**

This paper introduces FedAKD, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates attention-guided knowledge distillation to mitigate the impact of imbalanced data. The experiments demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves the performance of FL models on imbalanced data, particularly for minority classes, while maintaining privacy and communication efficiency. Future work will focus on extending FedAKD to handle more complex data distributions and exploring other techniques for knowledge distillation in federated learning.
